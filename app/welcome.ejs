        <span id="welcomeDescription">Our goal is to make a world in Minecraft that looks like a zombie apocalypse, or a world where people fight to stay alive after everything has gone wrong.<br>
            Travel from old, empty cities to quiet country spots, and if you're brave enough, go beyond the safe zones into places filled with zombies. But move fast, because as a scary warning tells us: The Zombies are Coming.<br>
            You'll need to think fast, build strong shelters, and work with others.br>
            Will you stay alive, or become a zombie? The choice is yours. Welcome to the Zombie World.</span>
